=== SOLAR CELL PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ===
1. Open-Circuit Voltage (Voc): 1.008 V
2. Short-Circuit Current Density (Jsc): 30.53 mA/cm²
3. Fill Factor (FF): 88.31%
4. Efficiency (η): 27.18%
5. Maximum Power Point:
   - Voltage (V_MPP): 0.916 V (90.8% of Voc)
   - Current (J_MPP): 29.68 mA/cm² (97.2% of Jsc)
   - Power Density: 27.182 mW/cm²
6. Theoretical Maximum Power: 27.182 mW/cm²
7. GaAs p-i-n Solar Cell with ~2 µm active layer

=== PERFORMANCE EVALUATION ===
✓ Excellent efficiency (>27%)
✓ Outstanding fill factor (>88%)
✓ Very high current density (>30 mA/cm²)
✓ Competitive with state-of-the-art GaAs cells
